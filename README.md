## singleton-log
### A simple C++ logger that makes use of a singleton pattern

#### Installation
* This library can be installed with cmake and make (cd path/to/repo && cmake . && make). This step isn't necessary because I keep a pre-built .so in the repo.
* Then include the repo path in your compiler's include path or move the .so to a folder that's already in the include path.
